Software types
==============
Which software type is an entry point and can be used for root software
instance.

Parameters are expected to be passed as of *.serialised recipes expect them::

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<instance>
  <parameter id="_">...</parameter>
</instance>
```

where `...` is a json expression (typically a dict).

TCPv4 ports allocation
----------------------
Service listening ports are allocated in the following pattern.
Base port of each software can be overridden, those are the default values.
- kumofs (persistent)
  2000: manager
  2001: server port (?)
  2002: server listen port (?)
  2003: gateway port (?)
- kumofs (volatile)
  2010: manager
  2011: server port (?)
  2012: server listen port (?)
  2013: gateway port (?)
- cloudooo
  2020: cloudooo
  2021: openoffice
- mariadb
  2099: mariadb
- zeo & tidstorage
  2100: tidstorage
  2101: first zeo
  2102: second zeo
  (etc)
- haproxy
  2150: first haproxy
  2151: first apache
  2152: second haproxy
  2153: second apache
  (etc)
- cluster-zope
  2200: first zope
  2201: second zope
  (etc)
Note: these are not applicable when (yet unsupported) ipv6 mode is enabled, as
stunnel (used to tunnel ipv4-only services over ipv6) needs its own listening
ports.
This pattern was chosen to make it possible to deploy this software release in
a setup where all partitions would share the same IPv4 without having to
provide many parameters.
Some ports are unused in the overall range to allow software types to grow.

common
------
Parameters which are available to all software types.

'mariadb-dict' (dict, optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MariaDB (used for catalog, activity tables and id generator) instance
parameters.
Defaults to {}.
Possible keys and associated value types:
'tcpv4-port' (int, optional)
  TCPv4 port to listen on.
  Defaults to 2099.
'database-list' (list, optional)
  Define the list of databases mariadb must provide, and the user having entire
  access to each database. Each entry in the list is a dict, with these
  possible keys and associated value types:
  'name' (str, mandatory)
    Database name
  'user' (str, mandatory)
    User login
  'password' (str, mandatory)
    User password
  Defaults to: [{'name': 'erp5', 'user': 'user', 'password': 'insecure'}]
'test-database-amount' (int, optional)
  Number of test databases to generate in addition of requested databases.
  A test database, if it were provided as a database-list entry, would look
  like:
    {'name': 'erp5_test_0', 'user': 'testuser_0', 'password': 'testpassword0'}
  with '0' being all numbers from 0 to test-database-amount - 1.
  Defaults to 30.
  Note: the default is way too much for "normal" usage. You are encouraged to
  provide this key to some lower value: 0 if you don't intend to run any unit
  test (ex: production instance) 3..5 if you intend to run tests without
  paralellism.
'full-retention-days' (int, optional)
  The number of days full backups will be kept.
  If -1, backups are disabled.
  If 0, backup never expire.
  Defaults to 7.
'incremental-retention-days' (int, optional)
  The number of days binlogs will be kept.
  If -1, binlogs are disabled.
  If 0, binlogs are never expired.
  Defaults to 'full-retention-days' value.
'innodb-buffer-pool-size' (str, optional)
  See mariadb documentation for innodb_buffer_pool_size configuration
  parameter. Value is used verbatim in configuration file.
  Empty string means unconfigured (ie, bail out to mariadb's default).
  Defaults to "".
'innodb-log-file-size' (str, optional)
  See mariadb documentation for innodb_log_file_size configuration parameter.
  Value is used verbatim in configuration file.
  Empty string means unconfigured (ie, bail out to mariadb's default).

  Value is used verbatim in configuration file.
  Empty string means unconfigured (ie, bail out to mariadb's default).
  Defaults to "".
'mariadb-relaxed-writes' (int, optional)
  Controls relaxed writes, which improves performances at the cost of data
  safety. DO NOT ENABLE THIS ON PRODUCTION. It's fine for unit tests and may be
  acceptable for development instances. Set to 1 to enable.
  Default: 0

single (default)
----------------
This creates an ERP5 instance suited for small needs/resources, or local
development. A minimal ERP5 site is created when instance is started.

frontend-software-url
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Software URL of an existing frontend.
XXX: meaning should change (or it will go away) in order to be resilient to
software updates - as they are visible at software-url level.
If it is not provided, no frontend will be requested.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GUID of frontend instance.
Not perfect yet: if that instance is replaced, slaves have to be reconfigured.
Mandatory only if frontend-software-url is also provided.

criteria.

Frontend software type as defined by the software relase at
frontend-software-url.

frontend-domain (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Domain name frontend must recognise as belonging to this instance.

setups - which also have a lot of available resources (several machines,
several CPUs per machine, GBs of ram, several machines...).
